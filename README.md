# ML-Digit-Classifier

This project implements a moderately complex neural network, which has the ability to classify handwritten 
digits from the MNIST dataset with a high level of accuracy. The [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database)
data set contains 60,000 handwritten digits from 0-9 presented as 28x28 pixel images. This implementation 
mainly uses a recitified linear unit (ReLU) function and an argmax function as nonlinearities, and uses a 
number of other linear algebra operations in order to make accurate predictions.
